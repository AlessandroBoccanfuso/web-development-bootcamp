    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate individual that started out their professional career 
            in the health sector. I have worked as a clinical dietitian, finetuning my 
            problem solving, critical thinking and interpersonnal skills. I have decided
            to start a new journey in coding, hoping to acheive the flexibility, freedom 
            and treatment that was lacking in the public sector. </p>
